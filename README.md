<h2>Job Visualisation</h2>
<p> This web app is being developed so that I can see data on different languages in the workforce. I am making it to help me decide which language to chose to specialise in for my career. </p>
<p>Live version: <a href="http://vis.johnarmstrong.co">Job Visualisation</a></p>

<p>Hover over donut sections to display bar chart inside of donut with salary breakdown for that language. Hover over each bar in the bar chart to see salary range and count for that language</p>

<h3>Technical info</h3>
<p>The seed file contains all the data that the app currently has. Run in development if you need to use sqlite3. This projrct is still under development so dont judge just yet!</p>
